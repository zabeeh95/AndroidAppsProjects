# Architecture Components Example
This is a hands-on lab from a Youtube channel "Coding in Flow" 
which demos the basics of Android Architecture Components including
use of Room, ViewModel, LiveData and LifeCycle.

It's a note app that takes very simple title, description and priority rating with
SQLite CURD functions that interacts with database.

Very detailed and well organized tutorial. Must-learn!
